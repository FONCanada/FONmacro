# Finances of the Nation's Main Macroeconomic Database

We gather, compile, and splice together various data sources to create this database. Relative annual changes are preserved across sources and are consistent with the latest data from Statistics Canada.

Population:
- National, 1867-1945: Historical Statistics of Canada series A1-247
- National, 1945-Latest: Statistics Canada data table 17-10-0009-01
- Provincial, 1867-1971: Tombe (2018)
- Provincial, 1971-Latest: Statistics Canada data table 17-10-0005-01

Employment:
- National, 1921-1945: Historical Statistics of Canada series D124-133. Note that these earlier years are for employment as of June 1 and are not annual averages.
- National, 1946-1975: Historical Statistics of Canada series D470-476
- Ontario, Quebec, British Columbia, and Newfoundland and Labrador, 1950-1975: Historical Statistics of Canada series D470-476
- Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and Prince Edward Island, 1950-1975: Imputed from provincial population data described above and unemployment data from Statistics Canada data table 36-10-0229-01; relative changes in regional employment to population ratios for the Maritimes and Prairie regions are then estimated from regional employment data in the Historical Statistics of Canada series D470-476. Details available upon request.
- Provincial, 1921-1949: A similar procedure as described for the various provinces between 1950-1975 (see above) is used for this period. Regional employment indexes are reported in the Canada Yearbook volume 1947. These are used to impute employment levels consistent with the national total for these years. For the Prairie and Maritime provinces, population data is from sources described above and unemployment data is estimated using the unemployment rates as reported by trade unions in the Interwar Labour Database to 1944. This is extended to 1949 using the same methodology as the ILD and quarterly unemployment rates in the Canada Yearbook 1950 (data for 1949 is bi-annual).
